PickFlick: A data science company that consults investors on movie futures.  

We want to predict the total box office gross on newly released movies.

This movie has just finished its opening weekend and we know the director and production budget. 

We use these features to predict the total box office gross.

I found that movies fall into two dictinct categories.

- Movies with large production budgets are more predictable based on their opening wekeend gross.
- Movies with small production budgets can vary greatly in how they do opening weekend and it is also less of a predictor on how well they will do in theaters.
